# This file lists all packages your project needs.
# Each line is a package name with an optional version constraint.
#
# Version syntax:
#   package==1.2.3    — exact version (most reproducible)
#   package>=1.2.0    — minimum version (more flexible)
#   package~=1.2.0    — compatible release (>=1.2.0, <2.0.0)
#
# Always pin versions in production to avoid surprise breakages.
