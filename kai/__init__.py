"""
Kai - Personal AI Assistant System
===================================

This is the top-level package for Kai. When Python sees a folder with an
__init__.py file, it treats that folder as a "package" — a collection of
related modules you can import.

LEARNING POINT: __init__.py
---------------------------
- This file makes the 'kai/' directory a Python package.
- You can import from it like: `from kai import __version__`
- It runs automatically when anyone does `import kai`
- Use it to expose a clean public API for your package.
